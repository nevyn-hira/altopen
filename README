# Altopen

## What does it do?
I realized that I was spending an annoying amount of time opening files in the right program. While opening up images in a viewer is the right default action (relatively low resources and quick to go through a bunch of images), a lot of the time I'm trying to open them to edit. Which requires me to right click, go to "Open With" and find the program that I use most for whatever file type from an alphabetical list.

It was driving me nuts so I figured I'd write something to address this (to go with my [macrokeyboard project](https://bitbucket.org/NevynHira/macrokeyboard/src/master/) BUT it runs perfectly fine as a shortcut key. It's been built that way).

## Dependencies
* xdotool
* pyperclip
* python 3

## Configuration
By default altopen looks for ~/.altopen BUT can have a configuration specified on the command line (`altopen -c configfile`). It looks like the following:

    [system]
    filebrowserclass = caja.Caja

    [mimetypes]
    image/png=gimp.desktop
    image/jpeg=gimp
    image/svg+xml=inkscape

To find the file browser class, use wmctrl at the command line. i.e.

    wmctrl -lx

Should give you output similar to the following:

    0x01000ee9  0 caja.Caja             nevyn-desktop Downloads    
    0x02e00007  0 mate-terminal.Mate-terminal  nevyn-desktop Terminal
    0x04800001  0 code.Code             nevyn-desktop altopen.example - altopen - Visual Studio Code
    0x03600003  0 Navigator.Firefox     nevyn-desktop License - Mozilla Firefox
  
The third column contains the classname. If you're not sure what filebrowser you're using, go to your file browser and hit "Alt+F a" to bring up the about screen.

If you're unsure of mimetypes, go to the terminal and type in:

    file --mime-type <file>
    
Where file is the file you need to find the mime type for.

The executable is passed to gtk-launch so can omit the .desktop part BUT must be a desktop file in `/usr/share/applications`
